Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra
service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.
Ansible is easy to deploy because it does not use any agents or custom security
infrastructure.
Ansible uses playbook to describe automation jobs, and playbook uses very simple
language i.e. YAML (It’s a human-readable data serialization language & is commonly
used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being
stored)which is very easy for humans to understand, read and write. Hence the advantage
is that even the IT infrastructure support guys can read and understand the playbook and
debug if needed (YAML – It is in human readable form).
Ansible is designed for multi-tier deployment. Ansible does not manage one system at
time, it models IT infrastructure by describing all of your systems are interrelated.
Ansible is completely agentless which means Ansible works by connecting your nodes
through ssh(by default). But if you want other method for connection like Kerberos, Ansible
gives that option to you.
After connecting to your nodes, Ansible pushes small programs called as “Ansible
Modules”. Ansible runs that modules on your nodes and removes them when finished.
Ansible manages your inventory in simple text files (These are the hosts file). Ansible uses
the hosts file where one can group the hosts and can control the actions on a specific
group in the playbooks.
By default, Ansible uses ssh to manage remote machine.
