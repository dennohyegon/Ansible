Playbooks are the files where Ansible code is written. Playbooks are written in YAML
format. YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language. Playbooks are one of the core
features of Ansible and tell Ansible what to execute. They are like a to-do list for Ansible
that contains a list of tasks.
Playbooks contain the steps which the user wants to execute on a particular machine.
Playbooks are run sequentially. Playbooks are the building blocks for all the use cases of
Ansible.
	Sample Playbook
---
 name: install and configure DB
 hosts: testServer
 become: yes
 vars:
oracle_db_port_value : 1521

 tasks:
 -name: Install the Oracle DB
 yum: <code to install the DB>

 -name: Ensure the installed service is enabled and running
service:
 name: <your service name>
A YAML syntax needs to follow the
correct indentation and one needs to be a little careful while writing the syntax. 
name
This tag specifies the name of the Ansible playbook. As in what this playbook will be doing.
Any logical name can be given to the playbook.
hosts
This tag specifies the lists of hosts or host group against which we want to run the task.
The hosts field/tag is mandatory. It tells Ansible on which hosts to run the listed tasks. The
tasks can be run on the same machine or on a remote machine. One can run the tasks on
multiple machines and hence hosts tag can have a group of hostsâ€™ entry as well.
vars
Vars tag lets you define the variables which you can use in your playbook. Usage is similar
to variables in any programming language.
tasks
All playbooks should contain tasks or a list of tasks to be executed. Tasks are a list of
actions one needs to perform. A tasks field contains the name of the task. This works as
the help text for the user. It is not mandatory but proves useful in debugging the playbook.
Each task internally links to a piece of code called a module. A module that should be
executed, and arguments that are required for the module you want to execute.
